          Paulo was a senior developer at Grooveshark.com, and Ashley was a freshman computer science major looking for an internship. Paulo interviewed Ashley for a position at Grooveshark. A few weeks later, Ashley was working there, and her and Paulo became good friends.<br/>
          <br/>
          At the end of the year, they began to get closer, however, Ashley was going to California for the summer. In August of 2011, Paulo flew to California to ask her to be his girlfriend.<br/>
          <br/>
          The couple fell in love quickly. On their 2 year anniversary, August 1, 2013, Paulo asked Ashley to be his forever. And now they are getting married August 1, 2014!
